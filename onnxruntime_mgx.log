[0;93m2024-02-05 10:33:40.266037610 [W:onnxruntime:, graph.cc:1296 Graph] Initializer Reshape/shape/1:0 appears in graph inputs and will not be treated as constant value/weight. This may prevent some of the graph optimizations, like const folding. Move it out of graph inputs if there is no need to override it, by either re-generating the model with latest exporter/converter or with the tool onnxruntime/tools/python/remove_initializer_from_input.py.[m
